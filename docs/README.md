# Commando v1

## What is Commando?

Commando is a Git commit message tool that enforces structured, conventional commit messages for individuals and teams. It helps maintain clean, disciplined commit histories by providing an interactive workflow that guides developers through creating properly formatted commits.

## Why Use Commando?

Many projects lack explicit rules for commit messages, leading developers to handle commits casually and resulting in messy, inconsistent commit histories. Commando solves this by:

- **Enforcing structure**: Ensures all commits follow conventional commit format
- **Guiding developers**: Interactive workflow simplifies proper commit creation
- **Improving consistency**: Teams maintain uniform commit messages
- **Enhancing readability**: Structured commits make history easier to understand

## Target Users

- **Individuals** who value clean, disciplined commit history
- **Teams** that want to enforce commit conventions consistently across all members
- **Projects** requiring automated changelog generation from commit history
- **Organizations** with code review processes that depend on clear commit messages

## Key Features

- Interactive step-by-step commit creation
- Validation of required and optional fields
- Real-time preview of commit messages
- Edit capabilities before final commit
- Support for breaking change notation
- Integration with existing Git workflows

## Philosophy

Commando believes that good commit hygiene leads to:
- Better collaboration
- Easier debugging and bisecting
- Automated changelog generation
- Clearer project history
- More professional development practices

> **Note:** If you dislike conventional commit messages or prefer unstructured commits, this tool is not for you.
